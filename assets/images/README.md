# Profile Images

## Adding Your Profile Picture

1. **Add your profile image** to this directory with the filename `profile.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger (square format works best)
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
   - File should be named exactly `profile.jpg` or update the filename in `index.md`

2. **Image requirements:**
   - Professional headshot
   - Square aspect ratio (1:1) for best circular crop
   - Good lighting and clear visibility
   - File size under 1MB for fast loading

3. **Alternative formats:**
   If you prefer PNG or another format, update the image source in `index.md`:
   ```html
   <img src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="Matteo Tarocco" class="profile-image">
   ```

## Current Setup
